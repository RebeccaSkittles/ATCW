## üêõ Known Issues

### Gameplay Issues
- **Land Card Placement**: Land cards need to be placed on the edge of the board to properly position on the very left and right slots. This is a known interaction issue that may require precise positioning.

### UI Compatibility
- **Screen Edge Compatibility**: UI elements may not perfectly align on all screen sizes, particularly around the edges where safe area views are involved. Some UI elements may appear cut off or improperly positioned on certain device aspect ratios.
- **Safe Area Support**: The game may not fully respect safe area boundaries on devices with notches or unusual screen configurations.
