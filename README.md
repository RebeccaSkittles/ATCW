# Card Wars
(NEWER ANDROID DEVICES - Just tap through the error saying the game is outdated, everything functions.)

Changes:
- Updated the project to work with Unity 2022.3.33f
- Fixed multiple shader errors and network errors
- Fixed deprecated code with updated Unity methods

Issues:
From what I've seen there's an issue on the Fionna and Cake level 24, I want to look into it and attempt a fix ASAP.
There's no ETA on when I'll be able to thoroughly look through the game as I'm currently trying to fix the PvP and Unity Project for Card Wars Kingdom.
